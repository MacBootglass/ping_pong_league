## Libraries used
### vuejs
It's one of the most popular open-source javascript libraries on the market, and I'm already working with it on several projects. It allows you to easily and quickly build a few user interfaces, especially SPAs (simple page applications).

### vuex
Vuex is a state management pattern and a library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.

### spectre.css
Developed in sass, it's one of the most lightweight css frameworks.

### eslint
This library allows me to improve quality of my code, respecting the rules defined by the javascript community.
